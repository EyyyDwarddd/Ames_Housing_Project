## Problem Statement:

I will be providing an update about the proprietary model to the newly employed Valuation Analysts of LendingCasas Inc. to assess key attributesof a property in Ames, IA. 


## Background:

LendingCasas Inc. is a fin-tech start-up in the mortgage lending space dedicated to building a proprietary algorithmic model that accurately predicts home values based on the attributes of the property within a given location.
Although some aspects of the valuation analysis is highly traditional (reviewing county records, cross-housing analysis), the company is determined to improve upon their model by ”lending” credence to this model in order to streamline the brick-and-mortar calculations that most Valuation Analysts do on a daily basis.

## Outside Research:

Used Realtor.com to assess how the housing market is in Ames, IA. This gave me a good gauge of what the home values are in this neighborhood, albeit the data in Realtor.com is 10 years in the future from when the data was collected from the dataset.
    

## Data Analysis:

<img src = "https://github.com/EyyyDwarddd/Ames_Housing_Project/blob/main/images/heatmap.png">

Based on the correlation heat map that I produced, Overal Quality, Living Area, Garage Area, Garage Cars, and Total Bsmt SF all display a positively high correlation with the Sales Price in Ames, Iowa.
    
## Conclusions and Recommendations:

- Valuation Analysts must give credence to the quality of the property. The more of an excellent quality the property is, the more they should add value to the property.
- Fireplaces appear to have a positive correlation with the sales price. Valuation Analysts should value the price of the property accordingly to the number of fireplaces a property has.
- Garage area and the number of cars a garage can hold should be valued higher than homes with a smaller garage area and where the number of cars the garage can hold is one or less.
